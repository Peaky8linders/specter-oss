"""Operator-role obligation registry — EU AI Act + Art. 2(1)(c) extraterritorial.

This module is the canonical mapping from operator role to the EU AI Act
articles each role owes. It extends ``app/engines/role_determiner.py``'s
6-role decision tree (provider, deployer, importer, distributor,
product_manufacturer, authorized_representative) with three additional
roles surfaced by *AI Agents Under EU Law* (Working Paper, 7 April 2026):

* ``gpai_provider`` — Chapter V Art. 53 obligations (line 437-438).
* ``gpai_systemic_provider`` — Art. 51(2) systemic-risk additional
  obligations (line 439-443; autonomy + tool-use decisive per AI Office).
* ``extraterritorial_non_eu`` — non-EU entity placing a product on the EU
  market triggering MSR Art. 4 / AI Act Art. 74 designated-responsible-person
  obligations (lines 1066-1075). Covers the US-based-entity case the paper
  flags as *most AI agent providers based in the United States have not yet
  addressed* (line 1071-1072), and any non-EU entity processing personal data
  of EU individuals in the offering of goods/services per GDPR Art. 3(2)
  (lines 1196-1200).

The module is data-only — no I/O, no mutable state, deterministic for the
same inputs. Engines reference these tables the same way they reference
``app/data/kb.py`` (single source of truth).

Citations reference line numbers in
``.planning/research/ai-agents-eu-law/full-text.txt``.
